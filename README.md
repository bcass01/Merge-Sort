# Merge-Sort
This project uses merge sort to sort a doubly linked list of strings alphabetically. Merge sort is an algorithm that breaks the linked list down into individual nodes and compares the nodes to each other to sort them as it rebuilds the linked list. This function is recursive and has a complexity of O(n log n).
